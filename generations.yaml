    description: "The first generation (SS30V/40V), introduced in May 1979, is a three-door cargo version of the Fronte passenger car. Initially equipped with a T5B two-stroke three-cylinder engine, it was later available with the F5A four-stroke engine from January 1981.

    description: "The second generation (CA71) was introduced in September 1984, featuring design elements from the GM M-platform. It continued with the F5A engine but added turbocharged and multi-valve variants. The Alto Works performance version was introduced in February 1987, being the first kei car to reach the legal power limit. A five-door body became available in October 1985, and a facelift arrived in July 1986 with new wraparound headlights and updated suspension. Production continued until 1994, though it remained in production in Pakistan as the Mehran until 2019."

    description: "The third generation (CL/CM11) replaced the CA71 in September 1988, featuring angular styling with an unusual glazed C-pillar on the five-door. It offered a unique sliding door version called 'Slide Slim'. When kei car standards changed in 1990, the engine was upgraded to the F6A and the model codes changed to CL/CM/CN/CP21. The Fronte name was discontinued in October 1989, making the Alto the sole nameplate. This generation was successful at home but not widely exported."

    start_year: 1994
    end_year: 1998
    description: "The fourth-generation Alto (HA11) appeared in November 1994, marked by simplicity as Suzuki returned to making a more basic car. The Slide Slim and column-shift Regina models were discontinued to cut costs. The Wagon R took over much of the Alto's market share at the higher end. New K6A engines joined the F6A, with the Works RS/Z model receiving the high-performance version. A facelift in April 1997 added side impact protection and new front design."

A thorough facelift in December 2000 (becoming HA23) brought updated styling and naturally aspirated K6A engines. The Works models were discontinued. This generation entered production in India as the Maruti Suzuki Alto and was exported to Europe until 2009."
